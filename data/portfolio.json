I have worked closely with Product teams throughout the mobility industry to deliver rich end-user experiences using embedded technology, and crafted big-data platforms which process millions of records per day. I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Lacuna Technologies, where I am responsible for the Billing Platform, and one of the primary contributors to the OMF MDS New Modes workstream. I am also a maintainer of mds-core, an open source project which provides a reference implementation of the MDS specification. I attended Boston University briefly, where I was a Computer Science BA candidate before I left in strong academic standing following my sophomore year to persue career opportunities.",
